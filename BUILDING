This project uses cmake.
On Linux, for an out-of-source build, type:

(...)/boxnet$ mkdir build
(...)/boxnet$ cd build
(...)/boxnet/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
(...)/boxnet/build$ make

For a debug-build, replace the "Release" with "Debug"

To get started, look at the "how_to_use" example in the doc directory.
